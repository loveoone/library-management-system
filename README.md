library management system review This project works library management system using c++ programming languages using statement,function,array,string. It does 1.Add, update, delete books 2. Register and manage users (students or staff) 3. Issue and return books 4. Search for books (by title, author, ID) 5. Generate reports (borrowed books, overdue books, etc.)  This module handles all operations related to managing books in the Library Management System. It allows users (librarians/admins) to add, view, update, and delete books from the system. All data is stored persistently using text files (books.txt), enabling data recovery and long-term use.
User Management 
 It defines two structures: User with an ID and name, and Book with an ID, title, a flag to check if it’s issued, and the ID of the user it’s issued to. It uses arrays to store up to 100 users and books. The program allows adding users and books, issuing books to users, and viewing issued books. All user input is handled using basic C++ functions like cin and cin.getline, and it uses loops and conditionals to manage records. A menu in main() lets the user choose what to do, repeating until they choose to exit.
Book Issuing System
A simple C++ console-based Book Issuing System that allows you to 
add books
issue them to users
and view issued books
This version is beginner-friendly and 
does not use file storage
date/time libraries
1. Copy the .cpp code into any C++ IDE or compiler.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Use the menu
Features
- Add a new book to the system
- Issue a book by entering user name and issue date
- View all currently issued books
- uses of functions
output
1: Add a new book
2: Issue a book
3: View all issued books
0: Exit the program
Book Return System 
 It allows users to view and return borrowed books using a menu-driven interface.
Features
- Display a list of currently borrowed books
- Return a selected book
- Prevents returning a book more than once
- Simple and interactive command-line menu
* How It Works
The system keeps track of 5 pre-defined borrowed books stored in an array. Users can:
1. View the list of books they have borrowed.
2. Choose a book to return by its number.
3. Exit the system when done.
Here's a simple and clear README for your C++ Library Simulation System 
It simulates loading and displaying book and user data for a library management system. It does not use real file I/O—instead, it uses hardcoded (simulated) data to represent saved information.
Features
Stores and displays information about books and users.
Simulates file loading by hardcoding sample data.
Outputs:
Book ID, Title, Author, and Availability
User ID, Name, and Role
Data Structure
Book Info:
bookIDs[] – Stores book ID numbers
bookTitles[] – Book titles (Amharic-supported)
bookAuthors[] – Author names
bookIssued[] – true if the book is issued User Info:
userIDs[] – Stores user ID numbers
userNames[] – Names of users
userRoles[] – Role (e.g., student or staff)
How It Works
1. The program starts by calling:
simulateBookData() to load sample books
simulateUserData() to load sample users.    2. Displays confirmation message.
3. Prints all loaded book and user data to the console.
Sample Output
Simulated File Load Complete.
 Simulated Saved Book Data:
101 | ኦሮማይ | በአሉ ግርማ | Available
102 | ፍቅር እስከ መቃብር | ሀዲስ አለማየሁ | Issued
Simulated File Load Complete.
Simulated Saved Book Data:
101 | ኦሮማይ | በአሉ ግርማ | Available
102 | ፍቅር እስከ መቃብር | ሀዲስ አለማየሁ | Issued
Simulated Saved User Data:
201 | Tedi | student
202 | Mr.Dagmawi | staff
System: Report Requirements
A library management system typically tracks:
-Books: Title, author, ISBN, availability, etc.
-Members: Member ID, name, contact details, borrowed books.
-Transactions: Borrow/return dates, fines, etc.
-Common reports include:
-Book Inventory Report: List all books with details.
-Borrowed Books Report: Show currently borrowed books and their due dates.
-Overdue Books Report: Highlight books past their due date with fines.
-Member Report: List members and their borrowing history.
System Integration 
This acts as the **central integration point** for the entire Library Management System. It connects all functional parts into one unified                                 How to Run

```bash
g++ main_integration.cpp -o library_system
./library_system
```
 Integrated Features Working 


* The `mainMenu()` function is the main entry point for running the entire system.
* All modules are designed for future extension and easy replacement of stubs with actual logic
